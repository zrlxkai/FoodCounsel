## Key Takeways

1. In truth, a large amount of food is manufactured but not consumed by humans and wasted in a lot of stages such as at harvest, farm and transport.

2. The food wasted will have significant negative environmental, social, and economical consequences.

3. With reliable data, we will be able to reach our aims at having per capita global food waste at the retail and consumers stages.

4. It is our responsibility to reduce food waste that is actually easier than we might think with the right and efficient strategies.
