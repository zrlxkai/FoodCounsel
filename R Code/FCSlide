### Problem Statement

Food wastage has become a huge issue due to the concerning amount of its increasing rate each year.Therefore, it's important to analyse this issue.

### Questions

- What are the trends of the change in the food loss percentage from the year 2000 until 2021?
- What is the total food wastage caused by households, food services, and retails in a region or country?
- At which stage does the food waste occur the most?

---

### Solution

Food Wastage is a complex issue and has been a serious problem globally. Hence, this project will help to visualize the data regarding food wastage to raise awareness regarding the gravity it holds.

### Objective

- To identify patterns of food waste trends from 2000 to 2021 globally.
- To visualize the data of food waste according to the food chain stages.
- To display the estimation of food waste according to household, food service and retail categories.

### Features that we have acquired from the dataset
- Estimated Food Waste over the Years, 2000-2021.		
- Estimated Food Waste by Region and Industries.		
- Estimated Food Waste by the Stage for all Countries.

## Key Takeways

1. In truth, a large amount of food is manufactured but not consumed by humans and wasted in a lot of stages such as at harvest, farm and transport.

2. The food wasted will have significant negative environmental, social, and economical consequences.

3. With reliable data, we will be able to reach our aims at having per capita global food waste at the retail and consumers stages.

4. It is our responsibility to reduce food waste that is actually easier than we might think with the right and efficient strategies.
